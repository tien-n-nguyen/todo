\section{Empirical Evaluation}

\subsection{Research Questions}
\par To fully assess \tool's effectiveness in identifying obsolete 
TODO comments, we seek to answer the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3.5em, label=\textbf{RQ\textsubscript{\arabic*} :}]
    \item \textbf{Comparative Analysis.} How does \tool compare
    to other tools proposed for a similar purpose, such as 
    \tdcleaner and \irsc?
    \item \textbf{Why \tool does better?} What are the factors
    that contribute to an improvement in \tool's performance?
    \item \textbf{Ablation Study.} How does removing individual 
    components of the ensemble architecture affect \tool's 
    performance? Can this be extended to better understand it's 
    behavior, and ascertain it's reliability? 
    \item \textbf{Real-World Efficacy of \tool.} How does \tool 
    perform on real-world software projects?
\end{enumerate}
